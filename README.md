# **HomeChum EV Charging Tracker - Home Assistant Custom Component**

A custom Home Assistant integration to track and analyze EV charging sessions using data from Ohme, Volkswagen Connect, and Octopus Energy, with support for manual logging of public charging sessions.

## **üìå Overview**
This custom component enhances Home Assistant by tracking **EV charging efficiency, energy usage, cost, and savings**. The sensors provide insights into **miles/kWh efficiency, charging costs, energy consumed, and idle losses**.

4. Add input_number to configuration.yaml
    ```yaml
    input_number:
      ev_public_charge_cost_per_kwh:
        name: Public Charging Cost per kWh
        min: 0
        max: 5
        step: 0.01
        unit_of_measurement: "GBP/kWh"
        mode: box


### **Manual Installation**
1. Download the custom component files.

## **üîç How Sensors Work**
### **Charging Efficiency Calculation**
- **`ChargeToChargeMilesPerKWhSensor`** calculates miles/kWh after each **full charge cycle**.
- **`DriveToDriveMilesPerKWhSensor`** calculates efficiency for **each drive session**.
- **`ContinuousMilesPerKWhSensor`** updates efficiency **in real-time** while driving.

### **Charging Cost Tracking**
- **For Home Charging:** Uses either **fixed rate (0.07 GBP/kWh)** or **dynamic Octopus tariff**.
- **For Public Charging:** Requires **user input** for cost per kWh.
- **Total cost is accumulated over time.**

### **Energy Loss Detection**
- **Idle Energy Loss (`sensor.ev_idle_energy_loss`)** detects when SoC drops without movement.
- **Public Charging Detection (`sensor.ev_public_charging_detected`)** ensures public energy usage is tracked separately.
